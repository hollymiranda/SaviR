This project was built and is maintained by the Situational Awareness Visualization Team (SAVI) of the International Task Force (ITF) within the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The purpose of this project is to create visualizations of the current COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing data from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Johns-Hopkins University (JHU), Our World in Data (OWID), World Health Organization (WHO), and United Nations (UN). 

SAVIs's goal is to best inform world leaders of the current status of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global, regional, and country levels through detailed data visualizations, including but not limited to global and regional maps, stacked area charts, (idk any more charts). Global regions are idenified by the parameters set by WHO (https://www.who.int/countries). SAVI identifies and tracks COVID-19 data for all countries recognized by the UN (https://www.un.org/en/about-us/member-states).

SaviR is produced through R and RStudio.
