The goal of SaviR is to collect the functions needed to access and
prepare various COVID data sources.

This package is divided into two main sections: analytical datasets and
data visualizations.

## Installation

You can install the released version of SaviR from
[Github](https://github.com/randyyee/SaviR) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("randyyee/SaviR")
```

## COVAD - COVID Analytical Datasets

| Metadata Functions   | Get Functions       | Calculation Functions | Production Functions |
|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| get\_one\_table      | get\_covid\_sources | calc\_add\_risk       | prod\_sitrep         |
| get\_country\_coords | get\_testing        |                       |                      |
